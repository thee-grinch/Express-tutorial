# Express Requests

In Express, handling HTTP requests is a fundamental part of building web applications. Here are some key points to keep in mind when working with requests in Express:

1. **Routing**: Express provides a powerful routing mechanism that allows you to define routes for different HTTP methods and URLs. You can use the `app.get()`, `app.post()`, `app.put()`, `app.delete()`, and other methods to handle specific types of requests.

2. **Request Object**: When a request is made to your Express application, an incoming request object (`req`) is created. This object contains information about the request, such as the URL, HTTP method, request headers, query parameters, and request body.

3. **Response Object**: Along with the request object, Express also creates a response object (`res`) that allows you to send a response back to the client. You can use methods like `res.send()`, `res.json()`, and `res.sendFile()` to send different types of responses.

4. **Middleware**: Express middleware functions can be used to perform additional processing on requests and responses. Middleware functions are executed in the order they are defined and can be used for tasks like authentication, logging, error handling, and more.

5. **Route Parameters**: Express allows you to define dynamic parts in your routes using route parameters. These parameters are denoted by a colon (`:`) followed by the parameter name. You can access the values of these parameters using `req.params`.

Remember to consult the Express documentation for more detailed information on handling requests in Express.
